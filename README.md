# Decision-Tree

1.
dataset_1 contains a main.py, train.csv, test.csv and an output.csv. The main.csv takes input from terminal "python3 main.py --train_file -train.csv --test_file test.csv. It is a decision tree algorithm written completly in python numpy and pandas from scrach. I have user dictionary to store the tree in this program.

2.
dataset_2 also contains a main.py, train.csv, test.csv and an output.csv. The main.csv takes input from terminal "python3 main.py --train_file -train.csv --test_file test.csv. It is a decision tree algorithm written completly in python numpy and pandas from scrach. I have build a class "Node" to save the tree and use it again for prediction. This algorithm can be used to determine continuous output, with a good accuracy.
