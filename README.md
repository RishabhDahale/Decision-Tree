# Decision-Tree


dataset_1 contains a main.py, train.csv, test.csv and an output.csv. The main.csv takes input from terminal "python3 main.py --train_file -train.csv --test_file test.csv. It is a decision tree algorithm written completly in python numpy and pandas from scrach. I have user dictionary to store the tree in this program. The program also stores the output vlaues to a "output.csv" from where it can be used for further analysis.


dataset_2 also contains a main.py, train.csv, test.csv and an output.csv. The main.csv takes input from terminal "python3 main.py --train_file -train.csv --test_file test.csv. It is a decision tree algorithm written completly in python numpy and pandas from scrach. I have build a class "Node" to save the tree and use it again for prediction. This algorithm can be used to determine continuous output, with a good accuracy. The program also stores the output to a .csv file for further analysis.
